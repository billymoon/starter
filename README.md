# starter

It's understood that whislt deno should be getting more stable as it reached version 1, Aleph is very unstable, and has been making regular api breaking changes. As such, this is an experiment to taste a bit of the future, not to replace current methods.

## Get going

Firstly, you need to have [deno](https://deno.land/) installed, and then you can install aleph globally like this...

    deno install --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --allow-env --allow-run -f -n aleph https://deno.land/x/aleph/cli.ts
    
This repo was created with

    aleph init starter
    
And versions used were

    starter [main] aleph --version                                                                                                         
    aleph.js 0.3.0-alpha.28
    deno 1.8.3
    v8 9.0.257.3
    typescript 4.2.2
